Upwell Description:

My game is a verry small game inspired by popular “rage” games like Jumpking, Pogostuck 
and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy but with a little less rage. Upwell is visually 
inspired by an indie game called Downwell. The goal of the game is to simply complete the 
levels by getting to the top and hitting the finish. But this is made a challenge because
 you are verry bouncy and you need to do precision jumps consecutively, but you can lose 
a lot of progress if you fail a jump. ​
